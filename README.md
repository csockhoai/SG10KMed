# SG10K_Med
The code here is used for analysis of the dataset and generation of all figures reported in the manuscript "Analysis of human disease variants from ancestrally diverse Asian genomes" by the SG10K_Health Med working group. The data files required for running the codes involve individual-level data, which will be made available for the purposes of replicating the results by request through the corresponding author and National Precision Medicine (NPM) Project Data Access Committee (contact_npco@gis.a-star.edu.sg).

**General requirements**

R 4.1.0 or above is required to run the code. Successful installation of the following R packages is required for execution of the code: tidyverse (1.3.1), RVAideMemoire (v 0.9-80), gplots (3.1.1), patchwork (1.1.1), sunburstR (2.1.5). Some older versions might also work.
